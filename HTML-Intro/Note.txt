<a href="https://www.youtube.com" > here is <a> is a tag, href is a attribute and 'https://www.youtube.com' is a attribute value.
<target="_blank"> mean the link is open from another tab

CSS -
<style>
    button{
        background-color: red;
        color: white;
    }
</style>

** If I need to add some space in between the button, we can use 'margin-right/left: 8px;

** Hover, Transitions, Shadows:
        - Hover -> .button-class: hover;
    * opacity - 
        if you wont to blur the button when hover it, you can use 'opacity' function

        - Transitions -> transition: opacity 1s;
    * if you wont to transfer color state to blur state smoothly
        - Transitions -> transition: background-color 1s;
    * If you wont to transfer background color to another color smoothly
        - Transitions -> transition: background-color 1s, color 1s;
    * If you wont to transfer background color and the font color smoothly

        - Shadows -> box-shadow: 0 0 0 black; [horizontal, vertical, blur]

** rgb and rgba
    - rgba mean red, green, blue with opacity(blur) with color format.

** HEX is also a color code
    eg:- #1d9bf0 [first 2=red, second 2=green, third 2=blue]
    to convert hex value to rgb value, you can use convertion calculator for that

** in the <p> paragraphs there is a default margin in between the text.
** If you have use same font-family through out the page for all of paragraphs, you can use as follows to improve 
   code reusability.
   <style>
        p {
            font-family: Arial
        }
   </style>
   then you can remove 'font-family' property from other css code

** If you need to get the special characters to the web page, please search 'html entity -characters you wont- '
** If you need to underline a text, you can use 'text-decoration: underline;'
